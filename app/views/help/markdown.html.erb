  What is markdown?
  ========

  Markdown is a text formmatting langauge which I think is a little bit hard to learn.

  Headers
  -------

  There are two ways to write a header in Markdown. Underline it like above, or

  # Prefix with a single hash to make an H1

  ## Prefix with two hashes to make an H2

  ### And prefix with three hashes for an H3

  Now you can shout about how annoying markdown is!

  Emphasis
  ========
  ### Italics

  You can _emphasise_ a word by surrounding it with _underscore_ or *star*.

  ### Bold

  You can __bold__ a word by doubling the **emphasis**.

  Lists
  -----

  * Lists are proabably
  * the easiest thing about
  * Markdown

  Links
  -----

  Links are really hard to remember. The format is square brackets around the name of the link, followed by round brackets around the link itself.

  Images
  ------

  Just because you learned how to write a link, it does not mean you'll remember that images are just links with a bang.
